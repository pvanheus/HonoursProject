	abstract = {On the advent of a completely assembled human genome, modern biology and molecular medicine stepped into an era of increasingly rich sequence database information and high-throughput genomic analysis. However, as sequence entries in the major genomic databases currently rise exponentially, the gap between available, deposited sequence data and analysis by means of conventional molecular biology is rapidly widening, making new approaches of high-throughput genomic analysis necessary. At present, the only effective way to keep abreast of the dramatic increase in sequence and related information is to apply biocomputational approaches. Thus, over recent years, the field of bioinformatics has rapidly developed into an essential aid for genomic data analysis and powerful bioinformatics tools have been developed, many of them publicly available through the World Wide Web. In this review, we summarize and describe the basic bioinformatics tools for genomic research such as: genomic databases, genome browsers, tools for sequence alignment, single nucleotide polymorphism {(SNP)} databases, tools for ab initio gene prediction, expression databases, and algorithms for promoter prediction.},

Clearly defined policy and governance in relation to free access to data and relationships with journal publishers have positioned {INSDC} databases as a key provider of the scientific record and a core foundation for the global bioinformatics data infrastructure. While growth in sequence data volumes comes no longer as a surprise to {INSDC} partners, the uptake of next-generation sequencing technology by mainstream science that we have witnessed in recent years brings a step-change to growth, necessarily making a clear mark on {INSDC} strategy.

Uses of the programs include estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates {(dN} and {dS)} between two protein-coding {DNA} sequences, inference of positive Darwinian selection through phylogenetic comparison of protein-coding genes, reconstruction of ancestral genes and proteins for molecular restoration studies of extinct life forms, combined analysis of heterogeneous data sets from multiple gene loci, and estimation of species divergence times incorporating uncertainties in fossil calibrations.

For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the {BLAST} programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped {BLAST} program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by {BLAST} into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting {Position-Specific} Iterated {BLAST} {(PSIBLAST)} program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped {BLAST}, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. {PSI-BLAST} is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the {BRCT} superfamily.},

Biopython includes modules for reading and writing different sequence file formats and multiple sequence alignments, dealing with {3D} macro molecular structures, interacting with common tools such as {BLAST}, {ClustalW} and {EMBOSS}, accessing key online databases, as well as providing numerical methods for statistical learning.

	abstract = {The development of functional–structural plant models requires an increasing amount of computer modelling. All these models are developed by different teams in various contexts and with different goals. Efficient and flexible computational frameworks are required to augment the interaction between these models, their reusability, and the possibility to compare them on identical datasets. In this paper, we present an open-source platform, {OpenAlea}, that provides a user-friendly environment for modellers, and advanced deployment methods. {OpenAlea} allows researchers to build models using a visual programming interface and provides a set of tools and models dedicated to plant modelling. Models and algorithms are embedded in {OpenAlea} ‘components’ with well defined input and output interfaces that can be easily interconnected to form more complex models and define more macroscopic components. The system architecture is based on the use of a general purpose, high-level, object-oriented script language, Python, widely used in other scientific areas. We present a brief rationale that underlies the architectural design of this system and we illustrate the use of the platform to assemble several heterogeneous model components and to rapidly prototype a complex modelling scenario.},

	shorttitle = {Programming Perl},
	abstract = {Adopted as the undisputed Perl bible soon after the first edition appeared in 1991, Programming Perl is still the go-to guide for this highly practical language. Perl began life as a super-fueled text processing utility, but quickly evolved into a general purpose programming language that’s helped hundreds of thousands of programmers, system administrators, and enthusiasts, like you, get your job done. In this much-anticipated update to "the Camel," three renowned Perl authors cover the language up to its current version, Perl 5.14, with a preview of features in the upcoming 5.16. In a world where Unicode is increasingly essential for text processing, Perl offers the best and least painful support of any major language, smoothly integrating Unicode everywhere—including in Perl’s most popular feature: regular expressions. Important features covered by this update include: New keywords and syntax {I/O} layers and encodings New backslash escapes Unicode 6.0 Unicode grapheme clusters and properties Named captures in regexes Recursive and grammatical patterns Expanded coverage of {CPAN} Current best practices},
