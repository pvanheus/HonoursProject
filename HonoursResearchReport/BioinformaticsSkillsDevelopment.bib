	abstract = {{EMBER} was a European project aiming to develop bioinformatics teaching materials on the Web and {CD-ROM} to help address the recognised skills shortage in bioinformatics. The project grew out of pilot work on the development of an interactive web-based bioinformatics tutorial and the desire to repackage that resource with the help of a professional multimedia publisher. We report here on the completion of the European project and its current status: the website is now accessible from http://www.ember.man.ac.uk},
