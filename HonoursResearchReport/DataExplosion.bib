	abstract = {Many of the challenges in genomics derive from the informatics needed to store and analyze the raw sequencing data that is available from highly multiplexed sequencing technologies. Because single week-long sequencing runs today can produce as much data as did entire genome centers a few years ago, the need to process terabytes of information has become de rigueur for many labs engaged in genomic research. The availability of deep (and large) genomic data sets raises concerns over information access, data security, and subject/patient privacy that must be addressed for the field to continue its rapid advances.},

The partners of this long-standing collaboration work closely together to provide data formats and conventions that enable consistent data submission to their databases and support regular data exchange around the globe. Clearly defined policy and governance in relation to free access to data and relationships with journal publishers have positioned {INSDC} databases as a key provider of the scientific record and a core foundation for the global bioinformatics data infrastructure. While growth in sequence data volumes comes no longer as a surprise to {INSDC} partners, the uptake of next-generation sequencing technology by mainstream science that we have witnessed in recent years brings a step-change to growth, necessarily making a clear mark on {INSDC} strategy. In this article, we introduce the {INSDC}, outline data growth patterns and comment on the challenges of increased growth.},

	abstract = {Motivation: This paper reports on a survey of bioinformatics tasks currently undertaken by working biologists. The aim was to find the range of tasks that need to be supported and the components needed to do this in a general query system. This enabled a set of evaluation criteria to be used to assess both the biology and mechanical nature of general query systems.
Results: A classification of the biological content of the tasks gathered offers a checklist for those tasks (and their specialisations) that should be offered in a general bioinformatics query system. This semantic analysis was contrasted with a syntactic analysis that revealed the small number of components required to describe all bioinformatics questions. Both the range of biological tasks and syntactic task components can be seen to provide a set of bioinformatics requirements for general query systems. These requirements were used to evaluate two bioinformatics query systems.
