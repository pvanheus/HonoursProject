A common shortcoming of the available tools is their inability to efficiently assemble vast amounts of data generated from large-scale sequencing projects, such as the sequencing of individual human genomes to catalog natural genetic variation. To address this limitation, we developed {ABySS} {(Assembly} By Short Sequences), a parallelized sequence assembler. As a demonstration of the capability of our software, we assembled 3.5 billion paired-end reads from the genome of an African male publicly released by Illumina, Inc. Approximately 2.76 million contigs ≥100 base pairs (bp) in length were created with an N50 size of 1499 bp, representing 68\% of the reference human genome. Analysis of these contigs identified polymorphic and novel sequences not present in the human reference assembly, which were validated by alignment to alternate human assemblies and to other primate genomes.},

Many of the most common uses of assemblers, however, are best served by a simpler type of assembler that requires fewer software components, uses less memory, and is far easier to install and {run.RESULTS:We} have developed the Minimus assembler to address these issues, and tested it on a range of assembly problems. We show that Minimus performs well on several small assembly tasks, including the assembly of viral genomes, individual genes, and {BAC} clones. In addition, we evaluate Minimus' performance in assembling bacterial genomes in order to assess its suitability as a component of a larger assembly pipeline. We show that, unlike other software currently used for these tasks, Minimus produces significantly fewer assembly errors, at the cost of generating a more fragmented {assembly.CONCLUSION:We} find that for small genomes and other small assembly tasks, Minimus is faster and far more flexible than existing tools. Due to its small size and modular design Minimus is perfectly suited to be a component of complex assembly pipelines. Minimus is released as an open-source software project and the code is available as part of the {AMOS} project at Sourceforge.},

	abstract = {Summary: The shorter and vastly more numerous reads produced by second-generation sequencing technologies require new tools that can assemble massive numbers of reads in reasonable time. Existing short-read assembly tools can be classified into two categories: greedy extension-based and graph-based. While the graph-based approaches are generally superior in terms of assembly quality, the computer resources required for building and storing a huge graph are very high. In this article, we present Taipan, an assembly algorithm which can be viewed as a hybrid of these two approaches. Taipan uses greedy extensions for contig construction but at each step realizes enough of the corresponding read graph to make better decisions as to how assembly should continue. We show that this approach can achieve an assembly quality at least as good as the graph-based approaches used in the popular Edena and Velvet assembly tools using a moderate amount of computing {resources.Availability} and Implementation: Source code in C running on Linux is freely available at {http://taipan.sourceforge.netContact:} asbschmidt@ntu.edu.sg},

A de Bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) which is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25-50bp) datasets. Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to {50Kb} N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and {3Kb} N50 on simulated mammalian {BACs.} When applied to real Solexa datasets without readpairs, Velvet generated contigs of around {8Kb} in a prokaryote and {2Kb} in a mammalian {BAC}, in close agreement with our simulated results without readpair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly which can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.},

	abstract = {An accurate genome sequence of a desired species is now a pre-requisite for genome research. An important step in obtaining a high-quality genome sequence is to correctly assemble short reads into longer sequences accurately representing contiguous genomic regions. Current sequencing technologies continue to offer increases in throughput, and corresponding reductions in cost and time. Unfortunately, the benefit of obtaining a large number of reads is complicated by sequencing errors, with different biases being observed with each platform. Although software are available to assemble reads for each individual system, no procedure has been proposed for high-quality simultaneous assembly based on reads from a mix of different technologies. In this paper, we describe a parallel short-read assembler, called Ray, which has been developed to assemble reads obtained from a combination of sequencing platforms. We compared its performance to other assemblers on simulated and real datasets. We used a combination of Roche/454 and Illumina reads to assemble three different genomes. We showed that mixing sequencing technologies systematically reduces the number of contigs and the number of errors. Because of its open nature, this new tool will hopefully serve as a basis to develop an assembler that can be of universal utilization (availability: {http://deNovoAssembler.sf.Net/).} For online Supplementary Material , see www.liebertonline.com.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Second generation sequencing technology makes it feasible for many researches to obtain enough sequence reads to attempt the de novo assembly of higher eukaryotes (including mammals). De novo assembly not only provides a tool for understanding wide scale biological variation, but within human bio-medicine, it offers a direct way of observing both large scale structural variation and fine scale sequence variation. Unfortunately, improvements in the computational feasibility for de novo assembly have not matched the improvements in the gathering of sequence data. This is for two reasons: the inherent computational complexity of the problem, and the in-practice memory requirements of {tools.Results:} In this paper we use entropy compressed or succinct data structures to create a practical representation of the de Bruijn assembly graph, which requires at least a factor of 10 less storage than the kinds of structures used by deployed methods. Moreover, because our representation is entropy compressed, in the presence of sequencing errors it has better scaling behaviour asymptotically than conventional approaches. We present results of a proof-of-concept assembly of a human genome performed on a modest commodity {server.Availability:} Binaries of programs for constructing and traversing the de Bruijn assembly graph are available from {http://www.genomics.csse.unimelb.edu.au/succinctAssembly.Contact:} tom.conway@nicta.com.au},

Although assembling a new genome can still be costly and difficult, it is possible to use {RNA-seq} to sequence {mRNA.} In the absence of a known genome, it is necessary to assemble these sequences de novo, taking into account possible alternative isoforms and the dynamic range of expression values.
Results: We present a software package named Oases designed to heuristically assemble {RNA-seq} reads in the absence of a reference genome, across a broad spectrum of expression values and in presence of alternative isoforms. It achieves this by using an array of hash lengths, a dynamic filtering of noise, a robust resolution of alternative splicing events, and the efficient merging of multiple assemblies. It was tested on human and mouse {RNA-seq} data and is shown to improve significantly on the {transABySS} and Trinity de novo transcriptome assemblers.
